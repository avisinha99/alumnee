  <p style={{'padding':'6rem 12rem'}}>At NIIT University (NU), our endeavour is to create a vibrant intellectual environment that nurtures the free thinker, the pro-active problem solver, the “I’ll do it on my own!” entrepreneur. Their journeys begin at our gates, and we are proud of their successes.
We are only as strong as the bonds that nurture us, support us when we are weak, and cheer us on when we flag. Which is why a dedicated team of volunteers works to create lifelong linkages between alumni and the university.

Our excellent alumni network refreshes these bonds, brings alumni together, supports them in their endeavours and connects them to opportunities for professional development and networking.

So, whether you are seeking to expand your skill sets or changing career lanes, whether you want to celebrate your success or share how your failures made you stronger, whether you want an opportunity to connect with your faculty mentor or just relive your campus memories, we are here for you. Remember, the bonds forged on campus are strong and long-lasting.

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
